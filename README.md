**LAMINR** (**L**earning and **A**ligning **M**anifolds of Single-Neuron Invariances using **I**mplicit **N**eural **R**epresentations) enables the **systematic discovery and alignment of invariance manifolds** in stimulus space for visual sensory neurons, providing a principled way to characterize and compare neuronal invariances at the **population level**, independent of nuisance receptive field properties such as position, size, and orientation.

### üöÄ Highlights

- **Continuous Invariance Manifold Learning:** Identifies the full space of stimuli that elicit near-maximal responses from a neuron.
- **Alignment Across Neurons:** Learns transformations that align invariance manifolds across neurons, revealing shared invariance properties.
- **Functional Clustering:** Uncovers distinct functional neuron clusters based on their invariance properties.
- **Model-Agnostic:** Can be applied to any robust response-predicting model of biological neurons.

## üõ† Installation

You can install LAMINR using one of the following methods:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Using `pip`
```bash
pip install laminr
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Via GitHub (Latest Version)
```bash
pip install git+https://github.com/your-org/laminr.git
```

## üî• Quick Start

Here's a simple example of how to use **LAMINR** to learn and align invariance manifolds.

```python
import laminr

# Load a trained response-predicting model
model = laminr.load_model("macaque_v1")

# Select neurons of interest
neuron1, neuron2 = model.get_neurons(42, 73)

# Learn the invariance manifold for neuron1
manifold1 = laminr.learn_invariance_manifold(neuron1)

# Align with neuron2 to quantify shared invariance properties
alignment_score, transformed_manifold = laminr.align_manifolds(manifold1, neuron2)

print(f"Alignment Score: {alignment_score:.3f}")
```
